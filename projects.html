    <h1>brettperry.info</h1>
    <p>I created brettperry.info as a portfolio project for web development. I
    am currently using Atom, Git, Github, and AWS to build it. There is a
    continuous integration setup using GitHub and AWS CodePipeline so when I
    merge the pull request in GitHub the changes are deployed automatically
    in AWS.</p>
