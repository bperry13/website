I created brettperry.info as a portfolio project for web development. I
am currently using Atom, Git, Github, and AWS to build it. There is a
continuous integration setup using GitHub and AWS CodePipeline so when I
merge the pull request in GitHub the changes are deployed automatically
in AWS.

Please feel free to provide feedback, advice, or ask questions.

Thanks,

Brett Perry
