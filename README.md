I created brettperry.info as a portfolio project for web development. I
am currently using the tools VS Code, Git, Github, and AWS to build it. 
The languages and frameworks include HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. There 
is a continuous integration setup using GitHub and AWS CodePipeline so 
when I merge the pull request in GitHub the changes are deployed 
automatically in AWS.

Please feel free to provide feedback, advice, or ask questions.

Thanks,

Brett Perry
