I created brettperry.info as a project portfolio for web development. I currently
have a continuous integration setup using Atom, GitHub, and AWS CodePipeline so
when I accept the pull request the changes are deployed automatically.


Please feel free to provide feedback, advice, or ask questions.

Thanks,

Brett Perry
